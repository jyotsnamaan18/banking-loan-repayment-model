# banking-loan-repayment-model
Machine Learning Model for accurate prediction of loan repayment or default in banking with Classification


## Introduction

In this hackathon, aim to build machine learning models to predict whether a loan will be repaid or not. The provided dataset contains various features related to loan applicants. We will preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis, engineer new features, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.


## Dataset

The dataset consists of two CSV files: train_loan_data.csv and test_loan_data.csv. The training dataset contains labeled data, including the loan status (repaid or not), while the testing dataset is used for model evaluation.


### Usage

1. Preprocess the data:
   - Use preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
   - Encode categorical variables and perform feature scaling if necessary.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Explore the dataset using summary statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis.
   - Identify patterns, trends, and insights in the data.

3. Feature Engineering and Selection:
   - Create new features that may improve the model's performance.
   - Select relevant features using techniques like SelectKBest or feature importance.

4. Model Building:
   - Train machine learning models using algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Logistic Regression.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Assess the models using cross-validation techniques to ensure generalization to new data.
   - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the models and their suitability for the problem.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Optimize model performance through techniques like grid search or random search.
   - Provide a rationale for chosen hyperparameters based on experimentation and domain knowledge.
